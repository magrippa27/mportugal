Digital modes have revolutionized amateur radio communication, enabling contacts under conditions that would make voice communication impossible.

## Popular Digital Modes

FT8 has become incredibly popular for its ability to decode extremely weak signals. Other modes like PSK31, RTTY, and SSTV serve different purposes.

## Getting Started with Digital Modes

You'll need a computer, interface hardware, and appropriate software. Many digital mode programs are available as free, open-source software.

## The Future of Digital Communication

New digital modes continue to be developed, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with limited bandwidth and power.
