Tobacco cultivation requires specific soil and climate conditions to produce quality crops. This article explores the key agricultural factors.

## Soil Requirements

Tobacco grows best in well-drained, slightly acidic soils with good fertility. Soil pH between 5.5 and 6.5 is optimal for most varieties.

## Climate Considerations

Tobacco requires a frost-free growing season of 90-120 days, depending on the variety. Temperature and rainfall patterns significantly impact leaf quality.

## Regional Variations

Different tobacco-growing regions have developed specific cultivation practices adapted to their local conditions.
