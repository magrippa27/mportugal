Curing is a critical step in tobacco processing that dramatically affects the final product's characteristics.

## Air Curing

This traditional method relies on natural air circulation in barns. The process takes 4-8 weeks and is used for many cigar tobaccos.

## Flue Curing

Modern flue-curing uses controlled heat to cure tobacco quickly, typically in less than a week.

## Quality Considerations

Each curing method produces tobacco with distinct characteristics suited for different end uses.
