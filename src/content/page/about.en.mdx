# About Me

For over four decades, I have dedicated my life to two seemingly disparate but equally fascinating fields: amateur radio communication and professional tobacco research.

## My Journey in Radio

My interest in radio communication began in my youth, when I first heard distant voices crackling through the static on a shortwave receiver. That spark of wonder never faded. Over the years, I've operated from remote mountaintops, participated in emergency communications, and helped countless newcomers discover the joy of amateur radio.

I hold an Extra Class amateur radio license and have served as a volunteer examiner for over 20 years. My particular interests include antenna design, HF digital modes, and the history of radio technology.

## Professional Work with Tobacco

My professional career has been devoted to the scientific study of tobacco as an agricultural crop. I've worked with farmers across multiple continents, researching cultivation practices, curing methods, and the botanical aspects of tobacco production.

This work has taken me from small family farms to large commercial operations, always seeking to understand and document the complex relationship between agricultural practice, plant genetics, and final product quality.

## Writing and Sharing Knowledge

Throughout my career, I've maintained a commitment to sharing knowledge. I've written extensively on both radio and tobacco topics, always striving to make complex subjects accessible to interested readers.

The books and articles available on this site represent decades of accumulated experience and research. I offer them freely in the hope that they will prove useful to students, hobbyists, professionals, and anyone with curiosity about these subjects.

## Other Interests

Beyond radio and tobacco, I maintain a well-equipped workshop where I pursue various projects. I've also maintained a long-standing interest in veterinary science, particularly as it relates to agricultural animals.

## Contact

I welcome correspondence from readers, though I ask for patience as I may be slow to respond. This website serves primarily as a repository for my work, freely available to all who might find it useful.
